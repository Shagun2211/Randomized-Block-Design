# Randomized-Block-Design

**AIM** : To study the effect of different months on Inflation rates of different sectors using Randomized Block Design Technique.
         a)To test if there is any significant impact of different months(**treatments**) on inflation rates.
         b)To test if there is any difference in inflation rates of different sectors(**blocks**).
         
Here in this project, we extracted data on inflation rates of different sectors in different months from the Annual Report 2019-20 of MoSPI.
Sectors have been reduced to four in number by adjusting the respective weights to make it easy to analyse.

**Variables**

Months : December'18, January'19, February'19, March'19, April'19, May'19, June'19, July'19, August'19, September'19, October'19, November'19 .
Sectors : Food and Beverages, Clothing and Footwear, Housing, Miscellaneous .

**Weights** with respect to different sectors.
